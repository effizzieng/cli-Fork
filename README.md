# Fluence CLI

Fluence CLI is intended to be the only tool that you need to manage the life cycle of applications written on [Fluence](https://fluence.network). It provides project scaffolding, compilation, service deployment, dependency management and installation, storage of keys and ids, etc.


## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites:

- Linux or MacOS (there are currently some bugs on Windows)
- [Node.js = 16.x.x](https://nodejs.org/)

To install and try fluence, run:

```sh-session
$ npm install -g @fluencelabs/cli
$ fluence COMMAND
running command...
$ fluence
@fluencelabs/cli/0.0.0 linux-x64 node-v16.14.0
$ fluence --help [COMMAND]
USAGE
  $ fluence COMMAND
...
```


## Documentation

A complete list of commands together with usage examples is available [here](./docs/commands/README.md) with a detailed workflow [example](./docs/EXAMPLE.md). Documentation for all configs that Fluence CLI uses can be found [here](./docs/configs/README.md).

A few recommendations are in order:

- To use cli in the development mode, run: `./bin/dev.js` (types are not checked in development mode because it's faster and more convenient to work with. Use typechecking provided by your IDE during development)
- To use cli in the production mode, run `npm run build` first, then run: `./bin/run.js`. If you want to make sure you are running the actual package the users will use, do `npm run build`, `npm pack` and install this tar package (the approach is used for tests)
- Don't name arguments or flags with names that contain underscore symbols because autogenerated links in markdown will not work
- pre-commit runs each time before you commit. It attempts to build and lint your project, runs prettier and generates this README.md file that you are reading right now. 
- If you are using nvm and want to commit using VSCode, place `.huskyrc` file to your home directory
- Don't export anything from command files except for the command itself. If you need to share code between commands - create a separate file
- Avoid using `this` in commands except for inside `initCli` function. This style is easier to understand and there will be less stuff to refactor if instead of using methods on command object you simply use separate functions which can later be moved outside into a separate module for reuse in other commands
- Use `commandObj.error` for human readable errors. They will be reported to analytics as events. Use `throw new Error` (or `assert`) for unexpected errors. They will be reported to analytics as crashes.
- Don't use colors inside commands descriptions. They can't be rendered to markdown and they will not be rendered to users of the packaged CLI anyway, when they run `--help`
